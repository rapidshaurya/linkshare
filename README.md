# Linkshare-Project #
## Description ##
Linkshare is a social site where users can share some recommended links with anyone. You can create an account here and then share and manage various project links, YouTube links, music playlists, Google Doc links, important website links, and so on.
## Features ##
1. The user can log in using their username and password.
2. A new user can make a profile.
3. A user can create private or public links depending upon his needs.
4. Anybody can search for anybody's public shared links by using their nickname.
5. The user can add new links, delete or update existing ones.

## Documentation ##
I am using mainly two collections to store data.

1. To store user details in database

2. To save your links in database

After logging in to LinkShare, you can add, delete, or update your links.

## Future Scope ##
Nowadays, many youtubers/companies/groups share a number of links with their audience, employees, or members. Here they can easily manage their links.
